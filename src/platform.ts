/**
 * Resize a tray window to a new height, fitting its content.
 *
 * On macOS the window is anchored top-under-the-menu-bar, so the OS default
 * (top-left fixed, grows downward) is exactly right — a plain setSize.
 *
 * On Windows the window is anchored bottom-on-the-taskbar (see place_window in
 * tray.rs), so the resize must keep the bottom edge pinned. We hand that to the
 * `fit_tray_window` Rust command, which resizes AND re-pins the bottom-right
 * corner in one synchronous step. Doing it as two webview calls (setSize then
 * setPosition) races WebView2's IPC — the second op is frequently dropped,
 * which left the window stuck at the wrong size or position.
